"This repository contains the Capstone Project for the C++ Laboratory course, focusing on a Weather Forecasting Simulation.
The project,  utilizes C++ programming language to simulate a weather forecasting system. 
The simulation includes temperature prediction, humidity calculation, weather condition forecasting, etc.
This project demonstrates my understanding of C++ concepts, such as object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms, applied to a real-world probleM
I would like to express my gratitude to Aishwarya Mam ,for guiding me throughout the project. Their valuable feedback and suggestions helped me improve the project.
